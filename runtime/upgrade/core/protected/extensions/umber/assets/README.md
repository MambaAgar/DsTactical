Umber assets directory
==============================================

In addition to working properly with modal-dev.scss from the assetsToCompile directory,
assets in this folder must maintain backward compatibility with all versions of modal.css that can be found in
the umber/assets directory.

A few things to take into considerations
--------------

If you have to delete or modify an image make sure it is not referenced in any of the versions/modal-*.css files.

When you make any changes either to the css, images or js. Make sure to test it on older copies of Brooklyn2014
as well as the current version.
